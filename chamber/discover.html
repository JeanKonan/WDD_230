                <h4>History</h4>
                Bouaké is the second-largest city in Ivory Coast, with a population of 740,000 as of the 2021 census. The city is located in the central part of Ivory Coast, about 50 kilometers northeast of Lake Kossou, the country's largest lake. It is approximately 350 kilometers north of Abidjan on the Abidjan-Niger Railway and about 100 kilometers northeast of Yamoussoukro, the capital of the country.
The city was established as a French military post in 1899 and has been an administrative center since 1914. The name of the city, Bouaké, has two possible origins: it could be a corruption of the chief name Kwa Gbéké, who founded the city, or it could come from two Baoulé words: "Boua", which means sheep, and "Ké", which means dry.
In the 1800s, a group related to the Akan, the Assabou and Baoulé, settled in the vicinity of where Bouaké was. Initially, the village was named Gbèkèkro, named after the leader of the Baoulé, Gossan Kwa Gbeke, and "kro" meaning town or settlement.
As early as 2002, Bouaké was occupied by rebel movements opposed to President Laurent Gbagbo, who was elected in 2000. Supported by Burkina Faso, these troops took control of the northern half of the country and made Bouaké their capital for more than 10 years.
Today, Bouaké is a commercial and transportation hub of the interior. Cotton, tobacco, sisal, and rice are processed there. The city is also a collecting point for various goods that are sent to Abidjan for export.
